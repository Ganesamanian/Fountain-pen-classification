# Fountain-pen-classification

This project uses SVM, AutonEncoder and RandomForest to classify 7 types of fountain pens. The foundtain pens are tested in three velocities namely 3.4, 4.5 and 9.0m having in four Nest/holder.

Amoung the three models Random Forest performs better since the dataset is small and dense.
